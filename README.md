# Threat Hunting with Splunk: Analyzing IOCs in the BOTSv3 Dataset

This documentation is a walkthrough on setting up a simple yet effective Splunk lab using Virtual Box, using the Splunk Boss of the SOC (BOTSv3) dataset, emphasizing on threat hunting, skill-building with Splunk, and the creation of detailed reports.  With over 2 million events from various log sources, the project aims to identify indicators of compromise, become proficient in Splunkâ€™s search processing language, and develop practical reporting skills for effective cybersecurity analysis and response.
## Key Components
- **VirtualBox**: Virtualization platform hosting the lab environment
- **Ubuntu Server**: Virtual Machine running Splunk Enterprise (e.g., version 7.1.7+ recommended), 
- **BOTSv3 dataset link**: Available via Github, containing over 2 million+ events
- **Splunk App/Add-on** (refer to dataset link above)- Required Add-ons for log source compatability
## Splunk Virtual Machine Network Configuration
- **Bridged Adapter**: Allows the VM to connect directly to the same physical network as the host, enabling communication between the two. Assigns an IP from the hosts subnet by dhcp if available.
## Splunk Web interface
- **Host Web Browser**:  Splunk Web GUI is accessed from the host pc using the assigned IP given to the Splunk server.

## Scenario:
The Splunk Boss of the SOC (BOTS) Version 3 is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge designed for security professionals to practice threat hunting and incident response using Splunk. The dataset simulates a cyber attack on Frothly, a fictional beer manufacturing company, by a North Korean threat actor group known as Taedonggang (also referred to as a DPRK-linked group). The events unfold on August 20, 2018, primarily between 09:00 and 16:00 UTC, and involve a range of tactics including credential compromise, phishing, remote code execution (RCE), privilege escalation, cryptocurrency mining, data exfiltration, and website defacement. The dataset includes over 2 million events from sources like AWS CloudTrail, Windows Event Logs, Syslog, Microsoft Office 365, Suricata, and more, ingested into Splunk under the index=botsv3
