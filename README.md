# Threat Hunting with Splunk: Analyzing IOCs in the BOTSv3 Dataset

This documentation is a walkthrough on setting up a simple yet effective Splunk lab using Virtual Box, using the Splunk Boss of the SOC (BOTSv3) dataset, emphasizing on threat hunting, skill-building with Splunk, and the creation of detailed reports.  With over 2 million events from various log sources, the project aims to identify indicators of compromise, become proficient in Splunkâ€™s search processing language, and develop practical reporting skills for effective cybersecurity analysis and response.
## Key Components
- ### VirtualBox: Virtualization platform hosting the lab environment
- ### Ubuntu Server: Virtual Machine running Splunk Enterprise (e.g., version 7.1.7+ recommended), 
- ### BOTSv3 dataset link: Available via Github, containing over 2 million+ events
- ### Splunk App/Add-on (refer to dataset link above)- Required Add-ons for log source compatability
## Splunk Virtual Machine Network Configuration
- ### Bridged Adapter: Allows the VM to connect directly to the same physical network as the host, enabling communication between the two. Assigns an IP from the hosts subnet by dhcp if available.
## Splunk Web interface
- ### Host Web Browser:  Splunk Web GUI is accessed from the host pc using the assigned IP given to the Splunk server.
